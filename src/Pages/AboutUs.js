    We want everyone who visits the rhode website to feel welcome and find the experience rewarding, going above and beyond the recommendations stated in Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act 1998.
<br/><br/>
WHAT ARE WE DOING ? <br/><br/>
To help us make the rhode website a positive place for everyone, we've been referring to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities, more compatible with assistive technology, and more user friendly for everyone.

The guidelines have three levels of accessibility (A, AA and AAA). We’ve chosen Level A & AA as the target for the rhode website.
<br/><br/>
HOW ARE WE DOING ? <br/><br/>
We've worked hard on the rhode website to ensure compliance where possible, but we know we can do even more. We've hired the certified professionals at ilumino, llc to help us achieve our goal of WCAG 2.1 Level A & AA accessibility.
The accessibility experts at ilumino, llc will conduct manual testing on a Windows or Mac computer using NVDA, JAWs, or VoiceOver, as appropriate. Proprietary software is used for all automated testing.
There are some areas of our website, provided by 3rd party vendors, that we have learned may not be accessible or usable by everyone equally.
We understand that all areas must comply with the WCAG 2.1 Level A & AA guidelines and we will update those areas as soon as possible.
We will monitor the website regularly to maintain our ongoing commitment to delivering a site that is accessible to the largest possible audience.
If you have any concerns about the usability of our site or find a feature that is inaccessible, please contact us using the information below.
We will make every reasonable effort to accommodate requests.
